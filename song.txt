Would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ahh
Would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
We don't talk much, not anymore
Broken bottles and slammin' doors
But we still care about each other
Say we care about each other
I know life took us far away
But I still dream 'bout the good old days
So we took care of each other
We were livin' for each other
